	<p>In multiplication, the number being multiplied is called the multiplicand and the number by which it is being multiplied is called the multiplier. The product of any number multiplied by a ‘zero’ is zero. The product of any number multiplied by ‘one’ is equal to the number itself. In a multiplication operation, the product can be equal to the numbers being multiplied or greater than, but never the smaller, except when one of the number is zero. For every multiplication fact there are two division facts. Thus, the product divided by the multiplicand equals the multiplier and the product divided by the multiplier equals the multiplicand.  In multiplication operation, the change in the order of the numbers being multiplied does not change the product. he division fact is used for finding the missing multiplicand or multiplier.</p>
